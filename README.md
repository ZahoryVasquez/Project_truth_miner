👀 What is TruthMiner?

In today’s world, misinformation travels faster than facts.
TruthMiner is an AI-powered system that detects fake news headlines using both classic Machine Learning and modern Transformer models (BERT).
Think of it as your digital truth detector — analyzing headlines and predicting whether they’re real or fake.
📌 Project Overview

TruthMiner is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project designed to automatically classify news headlines as either real or fake.
The project combines both classical machine learning models and a fine-tuned Transformer (DistilBERT) to benchmark performance and highlight the trade-offs between traditional approaches and modern deep learning.

🎯 Goals

Preprocess raw text into clean, usable features
Apply feature engineering with TF-IDF and embeddings
Train and compare multiple ML classifiers:
Logistic Regression
Naïve Bayes
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
XGBoost
Fine-tune DistilBERT for sequence classification
Evaluate models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
Generate predictions for the test dataset in the original file format

📂 Dataset

Training data: dataset/training_data.csv

Format: label<TAB>headline
label = 0 → Fake News
label = 1 → Real News
Testing data: dataset/testing_data.csv

Same format, but labels are placeholders (2)
Your model predicts and replaces them with 0 or 1
⚙️ Workflow

1️⃣ Preprocessing

Convert to lowercase
Remove punctuation
Tokenize text
Remove stopwords
Apply stemming / lemmatization
2️⃣ Feature Engineering

TF-IDF vectorization (unigrams + bigrams)
Embeddings for Transformer input
3️⃣ Modeling

Train classical ML models with TF-IDF features
Fine-tune DistilBERT using Hugging Face Trainer API
Apply stratified splits (80/20) for validation
4️⃣ Evaluation

Metrics reported:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
5️⃣ Prediction

Replace 2 labels in the test set with predicted values
Save results as testing_predictions.csv (tab-separated, no header)
📊 Results (Validation Set)

Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1
Logistic Regression	0.94	0.94	0.94	0.94
Naïve Bayes	0.91	0.90	0.91	0.90
Random Forest	0.89	0.88	0.89	0.88
SVM (Linear)	0.95	0.94	0.95	0.95
XGBoost	0.93	0.93	0.93	0.93
DistilBERT (fine-tuned)	0.96	0.96	0.96	0.96
⚡ Transformers slightly outperformed classical ML, but SVM and Logistic Regression were strong baselines.
